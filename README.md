# 🧠 Student Depression Data Cleaning & Analysis  
*A Data Preprocessing Case Study*

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **real-world data preprocessing and analysis case study** using a **Student Depression dataset from Kaggle**.  
The primary objective was to transform raw, imperfect data into a **machine-learning-ready dataset** by applying systematic **data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis techniques**.

Rather than focusing on model building, this project emphasizes the **most critical stage of any data science workflow: data preparation**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Real-world mental health datasets often contain:

- Missing and inconsistent values  
- Mixed data types and noisy features  
- Categorical variables unsuitable for modeling  

The challenge was to **clean, structure, and encode the dataset** so it could be reliably used for downstream machine learning tasks.
